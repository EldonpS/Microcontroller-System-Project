# Door Lock System Using Arduino Uno

This project involves creating a Door Lock System using Arduino Uno. We will be utilizing various features on the microcontroller to implement an effective security solution.

## Features

1. **Memory:** The microcontroller's memory serves as the storage for the program code, allowing modifications such as changing the door password.

2. **Input/Output Ports:** These ports are used to connect various inputs and outputs, enhancing the flexibility and functionality of the door lock system.

3. **LCD Screen:** An LCD screen is incorporated into the system to display text. This feature is crucial for presenting information within the program that we will develop.

## Project Overview

The Door Lock System project is designed to provide a secure and efficient solution for controlling access. Through the implementation of memory storage, input/output ports, and an LCD screen, we aim to create a user-friendly and customizable door lock system.

## Usage

To modify the door's password or make other program adjustments, you can interact with the system using the Arduino Uno and the incorporated LCD screen. This project ensures a high level of security while offering ease of use for administrators.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to meet your specific requirements.
